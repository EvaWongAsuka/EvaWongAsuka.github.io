            <h2>On Graduation</h2>

  <p><em>“We now knew we were passing from life into memory.” - My Name is Red</em>
         </p>
<p>In June’s Guangzhou, the solar zenith angle is close to 90 degrees, and the shadows escape exposure and curl up underneath the feet as an invisible mass. When making a picture, we have to deliberately leave some shadows to enhance the sense of reality. But the real does not leave a shadow, do not take away a cloud, leaving only some digital relics, for people to hang out. Or these years of light, a never ending summer, is actually a dream. Young people are good at dreaming, dare to dream, dying old people still dream, but do not dare to talk about dreams, because extravagant hopes become taboo, should not be put on the tip of the tongue. I feel like I have fallen to the ground like an old man, but time has turned back and I am like a baby again in a flash. I feel like I’m holding on to the past and sinking, but gravity reverses and I float around in the empty soil. This is not a violation of the laws of physics, nor is it enough to send an email claiming to have overturned the theory of relativity and proved Riemann’s theorem or something, but I owe it to all my teachers and friends who have been kind enough to shine on me for a moment with their charisma. I look back and realize that the golden age is not ahead, but behind me, in countless unanticipated moments. “I had so many extravagant wishes. I want to love, want to eat, but also want to become a half-bright, half-dark clouds in the sky in a flash.” The cloud is easy to scatter and the glass is broken, and the broken glass will be stuck in the palms of those who dwell on the past. When writing this ticket circle, the sunset light piercing the layer of clouds gently outlines the shape of the distant mountains, igniting a gorgeous smoke haze in the canopy, looking forward to the future of the glow issued by the gentlemen also like this distantly hanging outside my window.</p>
<p>Looking through the photo album, I found several books that I read in 17 years originally because I saw the recommendation of the philosophy teacher in the library. At that time, I would never believe that one day I would be able to sit in a classroom and listen to these unattainable teachings. Now those dreamy days have come to an end, but it is not a pillow of sorghum. The world is a place where there is a lot of separation but little gathering, where entropy increases but hardly decreases, and where angels occasionally come down and land on the tip of a needle with a zero measurement. Because this life is purely unexpected, I am not used to it, but I need it so desperately. The double life expands the dimensions of the world, tempting people to dig deeper into knowledge, while cunningly creating more cracks and pulling apart the gap between the known and the unknown. The more you learn, the more confused you become. Because the speed of seeing the existence of the unknown is much faster than the speed of measuring it with two eyes and two feet. I hate not being able to split up like a Banach-Tarski ball and live a thousand lives at the same time, a hundred years is too short.</p>
<p>Memory is the dust settling and the unfinished business. Memories cannot escape the brain’s tampering, editing, and loss, and I pray with fear and trepidation that they will be archived honestly, but in the end, they are not available. We spend all our energy learning how to set up our future, and no one teaches us how to say goodbye to our past. We open one task after another, layers and layers of task boxes stack up with no option to close them, they become background processes. The good things of the past leave too many thoughts, and the bad things of the past leave too many regrets. Both refuse to let people unwind. Memories as nouns are flesh and blood, and as verbs are knives that lick the blood, and once we contemplate how we are what we are, we cannot rest until we are dissected clean.</p>
<p>“You are walking on a plain, and suddenly you come across a wall, which is infinitely high up, infinitely deep down, infinitely far to the left, infinitely far to the right. In this riddle, I thought it was a metaphor for separation, but Cixin Liu revealed the answer that the wall was death. I was thinking of separation from life, he was thinking of separation from death. But this riddle can also be another solution, the old road does not have to retrace, old things do not have to be mentioned again, this is called growth. The fruit is made into wine, no need to remember the sweetness of the grapes, let these years of full planting, full of years after the long goodbye reunion.</p>
<p>The French say “Partir, c’est mourir un peu.” To say goodbye is to take a small step into death. Memory is bone of my bones, flesh of my flesh, time is a big cut, this body has nowhere to run. But pessimism contains relief, and pain conceals joy. All that we have lost is all that we have. So, there are green hills everywhere in life.(埋骨岂须桑梓地，人生到处有青山。) Good bye, I write it word by word, I look to interpret it, lips grinning, teeth slightly open, as if a condensed smile, as if a sincere prayer. Good bye.</p>
