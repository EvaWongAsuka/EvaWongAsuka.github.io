  <p><em>“We now knew we were passing from life into memory.” - My Name is Red</em>
         </p>
<p>In June’s Guangzhou, the solar zenith angle is close to 90 degrees, and the shadows escape to hide underneath the feet. When rendering a scene, we have to deliberately leave some shadows to enhance the sense of reality. But the reality does not leave a shadow, do not take away a cloud (我挥一挥衣袖，不带走一片云彩——徐志摩《再别康桥》), leaving only some digital relics, for people to hang out. Or these years of light, a never-ending summer, is actually a dream. Young people are good at dreaming, dare to dream, dying old people still dream, but do not dare to talk about dreams, because extravagant hopes become taboo, should not be put on the tip of the tongue. I feel like I have fallen to the ground like an old man, but time has turned back and I am like a baby again in a flash. I feel like I’m holding on to the past and sinking, but gravity reverses and I float around in the universe. This is not a violation of the laws of physics, nor is it enough to send an email claiming to have overturned the theory of relativity and proved Riemann’s theorem or something, but I owe it to all my teachers and friends who have been kind enough to shine on me for a moment with their charisma. I look back and realize that the golden age is not ahead, but behind me, in countless unanticipated moments. “I had so many extravagant wishes. I want to love, want to eat, but also want to become a half-bright, half-dark clouds in the sky in a flash.” The cloud is easy to scatter and the glass is broken (彩云易散琉璃碎), and the broken glass will be stuck in the palms of those who dwell on the past. When writing this article, the sunset light piercing the layer of clouds gently outlines the shape of the distant mountains, igniting a gorgeous smoke haze in the canopy, I look forward to the future, when the glow of you, my friend, is also distantly hanging outside my window.</p>
<p>Looking through the photo album, I found several books that I read in 17 years originally because I saw the recommendation of the philosophy teacher in the library. At that time, I would never believe that one day I would be able to sit in a classroom and listen to these unattainable teachings. Now those dreamy days have come to an end, but it is not a pipe dream. In the world, there is a lot of separation but little gathering, a lot of entropy increments but little reduction. You cannot expect angels to come down and land on the tip of a needle with a zero measurement. Because this life is purely unexpected, I am not used to it, but I need it so desperately. The double life expands the dimensions of the world, tempting people to dig deeper into knowledge, while cunningly creating more cracks and pulling apart the gap between the known and the unknown. The more you learn, the more confused you become. Because the speed of seeing the existence of the unknown is much faster than the speed of measuring it with two eyes and two feet. I hate not being able to split up like a Banach-Tarski ball and live a thousand lives at the same time, a hundred years is too short.</p>
<p>Memory is the finished and the unfinished. Memories cannot escape the brain’s tampering and editing, so I pray with fear and trepidation that they will be archived honestly, but in the end, it is not possible. We spend all our energy creating our future, but no one teaches us how to say goodbye to our past. We open one task after another, layers and layers of task boxes stack up with no option to close them, they become background processes. The good things of the past leave too many thoughts, and the bad things of the past leave too many regrets. Both refuse to let people unwind. Memories are flesh and blood, and to memorize is knives that lick the blood, and once we contemplate how we are what we are, we cannot rest until we are completely clean.</p>
<p>“You are walking on a plain, and suddenly you come across a wall, which is infinitely high up, infinitely deep down, infinitely far to the left, infinitely far to the right. In this riddle, I thought it was a metaphor for separation, but Cixin Liu revealed the answer that the wall was death. I thought it was goodbye, he thought it was farewell. But this riddle can also be another solution, no need to retrace the old road, no need to mention the old things, this is called growth. The fruit is made into wine, no need to remember the sweetness of the grapes, let these years of full planting, full of years after the long goodbye reunion.</p>
<p>The French say “Partir, c’est mourir un peu.” To say goodbye is to take a small step into death. Memory is the bone of my bones, the flesh of my flesh. When relentless time decides to take it away from me, I get no where to hide. But pessimism contains relief, and pain conceals joy. All that we have lost is all that we have. So, there are green hills everywhere in life. (埋骨岂须桑梓地，人生到处有青山。) Goodbye, I write it letter by letter, I read it syllable by syllable, lips grinning, teeth slightly open, as if a condensed smile, as if a sincere prayer. Goodbye.</p>
